# SiMa: Federating Data Silos

This repo includes the code used for implementing SiMa, as described in the SIGMOD submission "SiMa: Effective and Efficient Data Silo Federation Using Graph Neural Networks".

## Repo structure

* [`src`]()
	Contains python source files used for developing SiMa and getting effectiveness results.
* [`notebooks`]()
	Contains [`data_silo_federation.ipynb`]() notebook for easily comprehending the pipeline of SiMa. It uses an example of SiMa running on a small set of datasets (Opendata-small as termed in the paper). In addition, it shows how SiMa compares with other SotA matching methods in terms of effectiveness.
